# RokuTVController-Siri-Shortcut
This is an iOS shortcut I built to allow voice control via Siri for my Roku TV, as I couldn't find a solution out there that really worked well. Unfortunately as there is no source code to post, I will just be posting a link as well as images of the workflow to show the build without you having to open it on an iOS device. 

## Supported commands
- (power) On
- (power) Off
- Pause
- Play
- Launch (app)
